# React Context Module Pattern
Example of using the "Context Module" pattern for handling asynchronous tasks and data. This repository implements the following:
- Reusable `useAsync` hook inspired by Kent C. Dodds and popular libraries such as Alibaba's `useRequest` hook to perform async logic
- Context module responsible for exposing a useful API to handle asynchronous state and data
- Examples for using these components
- Strictly typed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
